Working on
DESIGN PHASE:
	- getting familiar with tools
	- Prof wants us to work with Daksh to complete a timeline
		- start of first month is this week
		- bring plan document, explaining our design phase, next week.
			Deliverable for the design phase is 5 - 10 page document and a presnetation by all team members
		- next page deciding whether we want to present
		- also need to decide sprint meeting (3-4 sprints in total)
			- deciding what we'd show at end of each period
			- ideal: 3-4 weeks 
			- deciding who does what
				- Daksh will talk to group and decide

		- Daksh will help the group if we're stuck, help to decide roles
	
-next week we'll get grading criteria from Prof. Bahar for mentor (Daksh) AND mentees
-deciding deliverables
	- deliver implementation and documents
	- might ask other things like presentation/poster?

- maybe have 2-3 members meeting, and then communicate meeting results to people who couldn't attend

- next week we'll talk about which features we'll want to add and how to implement that features (Bahar's comment: this should be part of the design phase, I don't think you will be able to finalize the implementation methods within one week)

WHAT TO DO BEFORE NEXT MEETING:
 - Prepare the design phase timeline
 - Decide about features and potential tools you want to use
