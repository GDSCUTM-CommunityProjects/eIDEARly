        # Connecting to The Internet

## Learning Criteria

In this tutorial we will cover the following topics:
-Finding internet settings on a phone
-Finding internet settings on a computer
-What is a Wi-Fi Network?
-Connecting to Wi-Fi

## Phone Internet Settings

No matter the type of phone, there is always a settings app that you can use to check your phone's settings; it almost always
has a gear icon and is called "Settings" 

If you open the app (by tapping on it), on Apple you will see at the top of the list of options
Wifi, which if tapped on will bring you to the settings you need.

If opening on a Samsung or Google Pixel phone, you will instead find a connections option, which if clicked on will bring another list of 
options. On the top of the list you should be able to find the Wifi option, which if tapped will bring you to the Wifi settings.

## Computer Internet Settings

On a computer, you can access the Internet settings in a few different ways. One way is that you open the settings in your computer and 
search for the network and internet option to get to the Wifi option. Another way is to go onto the toolbar (the bar with icons at the bottom) and
click on the icon that resembles 3 or 4 waves radiating outwards; this brings you directly to the Wifi settings.

## What the heck is Wifi?

You may notice that even though this tutorial is talking about connecting to the Internet, we are talking about the Wifi settings. Wifi, short for
wireless fidelity, is the term for the wireless network that connects nearby to each other. What happens is that the Wifi is 
typically managed by a device called the "router", and that router itself is connected to the larger network that is the Internet. 
Hence to get connected to the Internet, you need to connect to the network near you, or the Wifi.

## How to Connect to WiFi?

Once you have opened up the WiFi settings, you will see a list of Wifi networks that you can connect to. Some may have a lock symbol next to
them; that means that this network can only be used by someone that knows the password. To try to connect to a network, you need to tap or click on
the network name, and if there is a connect option press connect. On phones you only need to tap on the network name to try connecting.
If prompted for the password, type in the password and confirm; if you get it right the phone will continue to try and connect to the network.
Once the connection process is completed, you should see that the network name now says "Connected" underneath; this means that you have
connected to the Wifi! If it says "No intenet" however, it means this Wifi network does not have the connection to the greater Internet, so you need
to try a different network.

        # Search Engines vs Web Browsers
        
        In this tutorial we will explain the difference between a search engine and a web browser. 
        
        ## Learning Criteria
        
        By the end of this section, you will have learned the following:
        
        -What is a web browser?
        -What is a website?
        -What is a search engine?
        -Why Confusion may come between the terms

        ## What Is A Web Browser?
        A web browser is a program that can access the internet and let you visit webpages. Webpages is the name for files on the internet, and are often
        called simply "pages".
        
        Examples of web browsers are Google Chrome, Safari, Microsoft Edge and it's older version Internet Explorer.
        
        ## What is a Website?
        
        A website is the name for a group of webpages that are linked together. Even websites such as Facebook and Youtube are simply many webpages
        that are linked to each other. The key feature of a webpage is that you can go to different pages in the website from within a page in the website.
        
        ## What Is A Search Engine?
        
        A search engine is a website that searches the Internet for webpages. Examples of search engines are Google and Bing. 
        
        You can type text into a search bar on search engines to find webpages that are related to what you typed, and these pages are usually part of their 
        own website.
        
        ## Where Does All The Confusion Come From?
        
        It is easy to get the terms "web browser" and "search engine" mixed up. Often web browsers already have a default search engine built in,
        such that when you use the bar on the top of a web browser, it also is the input for the search engine. 
        
        Also, companies that run search engines may also have their own web browsers. For example, Google has both it's search engine, but also has it's
        own web browser Google Chrome, that starts with the Google search engine. Microsoft has the Microsoft Edge web browser, that also has the Bing search
        engine made by Microsoft. 
        
        The best way to remember the difference is that web browsers show you webpages, search engines are a group of webpages that finds other webpages.

        # Basic Internet Safety

## Learning Criteria

In this tutorial we will cover the following:
-how to avoid scams
-recognizing secure websites

## How to Avoid Being Scammed

The Internet is a very useful tool, but like any tool, there are some dangers. One of these dangers is the threat of scammers attempting to
take your money or acquire your personal information. These scams may come from email, or from social media, but there are common elements
that can help you avoid being scammed.

1.Do not click on any links. If it's a scam, then the link will most likely take you to a page that may lead to complications like theft of
personal information, or the loss of money, or malicious files being downloaded. If the email seems slightly suspicious, don't click unless
you are 100% sure that it is legitimate. 

2.Verify from the source. Some scams have the scammers pretend to be government employees demanding money, or saying that your bank has made
a bad transfer and that they need osme personal information. Some scans involve pretending to be your family members. As a general rule of thumb,
the government and companies will, never, ever message you to ask for your personal information; if a supposed government or bank emial asks for it,
it is almost guaranteed to be fake. If there is confusion, directly call or contact the organization (but not to the same number the message came from)
to clarify. 

3.If it sounds too good to be true, it most likely is. There are scams that say that you've won a prize for a contest you haven't entered,
or that you've earned back money from a transfer and need to click on a link to receive it. On social media, people may intend to deceive you
into a false connection. Trust your gut feeling; it will work as well as if someone tried to scam you in real life.


## What Makes a Secure Website?

Secure websites are websites where the connection is secured against outside influence from other computers. You can tell that they are secured
by their hyperlink: if you check in the web browser's top bar on a website, you'll see some text; that is the hyperlink. If you click on it, it should
show the full link. If the link begins with "https", it's secure. In general, avoid websites whose links do not begin with "https".

        # How to Use Google: Beginner to (Slightly Advanced)

## Learning Criteria

In this tutorial we will cover:
-the basics on how to use google
-how to use different google tabs
-some neat tricks to use google like a pro

## Google Basics

To use google on it's own is rather simple: here are the steps

1.On every google page there is a bar at the top, that may or may not have words in it. You will know it's the bar we need if when you click/tap
on it a blinking line shows up. Tap on that bar.

2.Type in what you want to search

3.Press ENTER if you are on a computer, or click on the search button. And voila! The results from your search will show up in order of what
the website finds fits your search the best, and you can scroll down (whether by arrow keys or by mouse, or by the bar on the side) to look through
the results.

## Google Tabs: Images, Videos, and More

Using Google on it's own is pretty good, but what if we wanted to be a little more specific with what we wanted to see? What if we only
wanted to look for pictures or videos? Google can help with that as well!

After searching for something, you should see a few tabs underneath the search bar. One of them is called Images and another Videos.

If you click on either one, they will only show images or videos that are related to your search! You can also use the serch bar now, and search only
for pictures/videos. If you want to go back, in the tabs underneath the search bar there should be an "All" option, that brings you back to seeing
all related results.


## Some Neat Tricks To Use Google Like a Pro:

The following tricks aren't necessary to use Google, but they can be handy to use.

When searching, if you want to make sure a specific phrase is included, put hyphens around like such: "Puppy Dog Sweaters".
Rather than looking for pages that only contain one of the words, Google will look only for pages that contain the whole phrase.

If you want to look for pages that don't have a certain term, use a hyphen before the word like such: Ford -car.
Google will then ignore any results that have the word you put a hyphen before and not display them.
