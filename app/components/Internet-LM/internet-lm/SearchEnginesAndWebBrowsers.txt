- Why Confusion may come between the terms

## What Is A Web Browser?

A web browser is a program that can access the internet and let you visit webpages. Webpages is the name for files on the internet, and are often
called simply "pages".

Examples of web browsers are Googl Chrome, Safari, Microsoft Edge and it's older version Internet Explorer.

## What is a Website?

A website is the name for a group of webpages that are linked together. Even websites such as Facebook and Youtube are simply many webpages
that are linked to each other. The key feature of a webpage is that you can go to different pages in the website from within a page in the website.

## What Is A Search Engine?

A search engine is a website that searches the Internet for webpages. Examples of search engines are Google and Bing. 

You can type text into a search bar on search engines to find webpages that are related to what you typed, and these pages are usually part of their 
own website.

## Where Does All The Confusion Come From?

It is easy to get the terms "web browser" and "search engine" mixed up. Often web browsers already have a default search engine built in,
such that when you use the bar on the top of a web browser, it also is the input for the search engine. 

Also, companies that run search engines may also have their own web browsers. For example, Google has both it's search engine, but also has it's
own web browser Google Chrome, that starts with the Google search engine. Microsoft has the Microsoft Edge web browser, that also has the Bing search
engine made by Microsoft. 

The best way to remember the difference is that web browsers show you webpages, search engines are a group of webpages that finds other webpages.
