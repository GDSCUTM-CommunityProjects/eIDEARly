## How to Avoid Being Scammed

The Internet is a very useful tool, but like any tool, there are some dangers. One of these dangers is the threat of scammers attempting to
take your money or acquire your personal information. These scams may come from email, or from social media, but there are common elements
that can help you avoid being scammed.

1. Do not click on any links. If it's a scam, then the link will most likely take you to a page that may lead to complications like theft of
personal information, or the loss of money, or malicious files being downloaded. If the email seems slightly suspicious, don't click unless
you are 100% sure that it is legitimate. 

2. Verify from the source. Some scams have the scammers pretend to be government employees demanding money, or saying that your bank has made
a bad transfer and that they need osme personal information. Some scans involve pretending to be your family members. As a general rule of thumb,
the government and companies will, never, ever message you to ask for your personal information; if a supposed government or bank emial asks for it,
it is almost guaranteed to be fake. If there is confusion, directly call or contact the organization (but not to the same number the message came from)
to clarify. 

3. If it sounds too good to be true, it most likely is. There are scams that say that you've won a prize for a contest you haven't entered,
or that you've earned back money from a transfer and need to click on a link to receive it. On social media, people may intend to deceive you
into a false connection. Trust your gut feeling; it will work as well as if someone tried to scam you in real life.


## What Makes a Secure Website?

Secure websites are websites where the connection is secured against outside influence from other computers. You can tell that they are secured
by their hyperlink: if you check in the web browser's top bar on a website, you'll see some text; that is the hyperlink. If you click on it, it should
show the full link. If the link begins with "https", it's secure. In general, avoid websites whose links do not begin with "https".
