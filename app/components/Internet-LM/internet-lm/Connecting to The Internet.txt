# Connecting to The Internet

## Learning Criteria

In this tutorial we will cover the following topics:
- Finding internet settings on a phone
- Finding internet settings on a computer
- What is a Wi-Fi Network?
- Connecting to Wi-Fi

## Phone Internet Settings

No matter the type of phone, there is always a settings app that you can use to check your phone's settings; it almost always
has a gear icon and is called "Settings" 

If you open the app (by tapping on it), on Apple you will see at the top of the list of options
Wifi, which if tapped on will bring you to the settings you need.

If opening on a Samsung or Google Pixel phone, you will instead find a connections option, which if clicked on will bring another list of 
options. On the top of the list you should be able to find the Wifi option, which if tapped will bring you to the Wifi settings.

## Computer Internet Settings

On a computer, you can access the Internet settings in a few different ways. One way is that you open the settings in your computer and 
search for the network and internet option to get to the Wifi option. Another way is to go onto the toolbar (the bar with icons at the bottom) and
click on the icon that resembles 3 or 4 waves radiating outwards; this brings you directly to the Wifi settings.

## What the heck is Wifi?

You may notice that even though this tutorial is talking about connecting to the Internet, we are talking about the Wifi settings. Wifi, short for
wireless fidelity, is the term for the wireless network that connects nearby to each other. What happens is that the Wifi is 
typically managed by a device called the "router", and that router itself is connected to the larger network that is the Internet. 
Hence to get connected to the Internet, you need to connect to the network near you, or the Wifi.

## How to Connect to WiFi?

Once you have opened up the WiFi settings, you will see a list of Wifi networks that you can connect to. Some may have a lock symbol next to
them; that means that this network can only be used by someone that knows the password. To try to connect to a network, you need to tap or click on
the network name, and if there is a connect option press connect. On phones you only need to tap on the network name to try connecting.
If prompted for the password, type in the password and confirm; if you get it right the phone will continue to try and connect to the network.
Once the connection process is completed, you should see that the network name now says "Connected" underneath; this means that you have
connected to the Wifi! If it says "No intenet" however, it means this Wifi network does not have the connection to the greater Internet, so you need
to try a different network.
