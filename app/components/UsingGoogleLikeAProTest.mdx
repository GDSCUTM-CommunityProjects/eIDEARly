- some neat tricks to use google like a pro

## Google Basics

To use google on it's own is rather simple: here are the steps

1. On every google page there is a bar at the top, that may or may not have words in it. You will know it's the bar we need if when you click/tap
on it a blinking line shows up. Tap on that bar.

2. Type in what you want to search

3. Press ENTER if you are on a computer, or click on the search button. And voila! The results from your search will show up in order of what
the website finds fits your search the best, and you can scroll down (whether by arrow keys or by mouse, or by the bar on the side) to look through
the results.

## Google Tabs: Images, Videos, and More

Using Google on it's own is pretty good, but what if we wanted to be a little more specific with what we wanted to see? What if we only
wanted to look for pictures or videos? Google can help with that as well!

After searching for something, you should see a few tabs underneath the search bar. One of them is called Images and another Videos.

If you click on either one, they will only show images or videos that are related to your search! You can also use the serch bar now, and search only
for pictures/videos. If you want to go back, in the tabs underneath the search bar there should be an "All" option, that brings you back to seeing
all related results.


## Some Neat Tricks To Use Google Like a Pro:

The following tricks aren't necessary to use Google, but they can be handy to use.

When searching, if you want to make sure a specific phrase is included, put hyphens around like such: "Puppy Dog Sweaters".
Rather than looking for pages that only contain one of the words, Google will look only for pages that contain the whole phrase.

If you want to look for pages that don't have a certain term, use a hyphen before the word like such: Ford -car.
Google will then ignore any results that have the word you put a hyphen before and not display them.
